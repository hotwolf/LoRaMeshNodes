title: An Inconspicuous Solar Node Design
---

This is an attempt to build an inconspicuous solar node.
The antenna is hidden along with the radio in an 75mm PVC-U pipe.
To avoid an eye-catching solar panel, I'm using threeflexible 6V panels, wrapped around the PVC-U pipe,

I've made two attempts to attach the solar panels to the PVC-U pipe: one using construction adhesive and one using superglue.
Unfortunately, both turned out messy.
If I ever build a third SSNvB repeater, I tend towards usin superlue again.
But, first I Need to see which glue better withstands the weather.

The new repeater model is mounted on a rail, so it can be easily removed and reattached.

The inside is derived from the SSNvD model.

This is what the repeater looks like in the inside.
