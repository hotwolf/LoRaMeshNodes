title: New Stationary Solar Node
---

I've designed a stationary solar node (SSNvA) that sits into a 40mm PVC pipe, which serves as enclosure and as antenna pole.
The radio (Heltec T114) and the antenna (Ziisor 8DBi 55cm) fit into the top end of the pole.

The battery (32700 6500mAh LiFePO4) along with the MPPT-controller (SDBK03TA) and MBS are inserted into the bottom end of the pole. Im using a cheap 5V 10W solar panel, that already comes with a wall mount. It just needs an adapter to mount it to the pole.

I've added a Scruton helix to the pole, just to give it a better chance to withstand the fall weather.
