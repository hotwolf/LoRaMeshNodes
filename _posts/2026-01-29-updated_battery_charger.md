title: Updated Battery Charger
---

I've made an update to the [LiFePo4Charger](https://github.com/hotwolf/LoRaMeshNodes/tree/main/LiFePo4Charger).
It now has a hole on the bottom of the battery compartment, which makes the removal of the battery much easier.

So far my [MeshCore Repeater]({{ site.url }}/2025/10/20/new-stationary-solar-node.html) has been running non-stop since October, but there have been days where the battery was drained to a critical level.
Just in case it doessn't make it through the winter, I've build a simple 32700 LiFePO4 charger, to precharge a spare battery that I can put into the repeater if necessary.
