title: New Battery Charger
---

So far my [MeshCore Repeater]({{ site.url }}/2025/10/20/new-stationary-solar-node.html) has been running non-stop since October, but there have been days where the battery was drained to a critical level.
Just in case it doessn't make it through the winter, I've build a simple 32700 LiFePO4 charger, to precharge a spare battery that I can put into the repeater if necessary.
